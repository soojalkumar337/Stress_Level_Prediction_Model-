
🧠 Stress Level Prediction Model (Machine Learning + Streamlit App)
📋 Project Overview

This project is a machine learning web application built using scikit-learn and Streamlit that predicts a person’s 
stress level based on physiological and lifestyle features such as age, sleep duration, heart rate, and work hours.

The dataset is synthetically generated, making it self-contained and reproducible. The model classifies stress into three categories:

😌 Low Stress

🙂 Moderate Stress

😫 High Stress


🎯 Objective
To demonstrate the practical use of supervised machine learning (classification) in predicting human stress levels and deploying it as an interactive web app using Streamlit Cloud.

⚙️ Tech Stack
